# freight-rail-delay-prediction
This project investigates short-term arrival delay time prediction in freight rail operations using historical operational datasets and machine learning models. The framework captures delay propagation patterns to enhance prediction accuracy, improve operational efficiency, and assist decision-making in freight rail network management.
